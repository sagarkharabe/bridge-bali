    * Users can create playlists of levels
    * Creators can create campaigns: series of levels which must be completed in order
    * Store info on playthroughs
    * Determine level difficulty based on attempts at a level vs. completions
    * Track who finishes fastest and with the fewest girders
    * Play against ghosts of previous plays
    * Social sharing
